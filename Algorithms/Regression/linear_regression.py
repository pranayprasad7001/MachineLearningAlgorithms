# Making a single prediction (for example the salary of an employee with 12 years of experience)
#  Notice that the value of the feature (12 years) was input in a double pair of square brackets.
#  That's because the "predict" method always expects a 2D array as the format of its inputs.
#  And putting 12 into a double pair of square brackets makes the input exactly a 2D array
print("\nthe salary of an employee with 12 years of experience: ", regressor.predict([[12]]))

# Getting the final linear regression equation with the values of the coefficients.
# Linear Equation -> y = b0 + b1 * x1
# Slope ( b1 ), alias 'coefficient' ( coef_ )
# y intercept ( b0 ), alias 'intercept' ( intercept_ )
print("Coefficient or coef ( alias slope ): ", regressor.coef_)
print("intercept or y_intercept: ", regressor.intercept_)

# Therefore, the equation of our simple linear regression model is:
# Salary=9345.94Ã—YearsExperience+26816.19
# To get these coefficients we called the "coef_" and "intercept_" attributes from our regressor object.
# Attributes in Python are different from methods and usually return a simple value or an array of values.
